Identify roles: Store, Action, Reducer

// Store

Holds the entire application state

Only one store in a Redux app

Created using a reducer

Example:

{
  count: 0,
  user: { name: "Pooja" }
}

// Action

A plain JavaScript object

Describes what happened

Must have a type

Example:

{ type: "INCREMENT" }

// Reducer

A pure function

Decides how state changes

Takes state and action, returns new state

(state, action) => newState
