Explain Redux data flow (Very Important ⭐)

Redux follows one-way data flow:

UI → Action → Reducer → Store → UI

Step-by-step:

User clicks a button in UI

UI dispatches an action

Action goes to reducer

Reducer creates new state

Store saves the new state

UI automatically re-renders with updated data

Example:

dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
