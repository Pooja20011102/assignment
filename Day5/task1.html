    <h1>A paragraph with an id,class,title attribute</h1>
    <p id = "para" class = "paragraph" title = "science and its effect on our lives.">A remarkable 
        feature of this century is the advancement of science and its impact on nearly every 
        aspect of society. Today's scientists are exploring broader areas of knowledge, building on the 
        groundwork established by earlier generations. Modern civilization heavily relies on scientists 
        and inventors. We depend on doctors investigating the causes and cures of diseases, chemists analyzing
         our food and ensuring clean water, entomologists combating insect pests, engineers who transcend barriers 
         of time and space, and many other specialists who contribute to agricultural and industrial development. 
         The progress in science and technology has connected different parts of the world more closely than ever 
         before, enabling us to reach far-off places in a very short time.
