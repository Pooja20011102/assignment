    <h1>The Thirsty Crow</h1>
    <p  style = "color : oklch(0.654 0.14 116.039 / 0.98)"">One hot summer day when there had been no rain for months and all the ponds and rivers had dried up. A thirsty crow was searching for water. At last, he spotted a pitcher of cool water in a garden and flew down to take a drink, but when he put his head into the neck of the picture, it was only half full, and the crow could not reach the water. 

    The poor crow knew that if he did not get a drink, soon, he would die of thirst. He had to find some way of getting to the water in the picture as he looked around, wondering what to do. He saw some pebbles on the path and he had an idea, he picked up a pebble in his beak and dropped it into the pitcher. The water level rose a little. The bird got another pebble and dropped it in the water. A little more. The crow worked very hard, dropping more and more bubbles into the picture until the water was almost at the top, at last, the bird was able to reach the water, and he drank and drank until he could drink no more. His clever idea had saved his life.</p>

    <h2>Moral of the story</h2>
    <p style = "color :  rgb(150 50 50)">Where there’s a will, there’s a way. This short story for children helps children understand the concept of resilience and smart work. Though the water in the pitcher was too shallow the crow did not give up by just looking at the difficulty of the situation. He used his abilities of quick thinking and came up with a plan that helped him quench his thirst. Dropping pebbles one by one into the pitcher also exhausted him but he did not stop until the water level rose.</p>
